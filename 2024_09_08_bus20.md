## 1.1 The Nature of busienss

* business is an organization that strives for a profit by providing goods and services desired by its customers.
* goods are tangible items manufactured by businesses, like a laptop.
* services are intangible offerings of a business that can't be held, touched, or stored.
* the goods and services that businesses create are the basis of our standard of living
* standard of living of any country is measured by the ouput of goods and services people can buy with the money they have
* U.S. has one of the hiest sandards of living in the world.
* even though Switzerland and Germany have higher average wages than the U.S., their standards of living aren't higher, because prices are much higher.
* business have a key role in determining our quality of life by providing jobs and goods and services to society.
* quality of life refers to the general level of human happiness based on things like life expectancy, educational standards, health, sanitation, and leisure time.
* risk is the potential to lose time and money or otherwise not be able to accomplish an organization's goals
* revenue is the money a company receives by providing services or selling goods to customers
* costs are expenses for rent, salaries, supplies, transportation, and many other items that a company incurs from creating and selling goods and services.
* profit is the money left over after it pays all costs
* a loss is when a company's costs are more than revenues

### Not-for-Profit Organizations

* not-for-profit organization is an organization that exists to achieve some goal other than the usual business goal of profit.
* charities like habitat for humanity, united way, american cancer society, etc...
* government is our largest most pervasive not-for-profit group
* more than 1.5 million nongovernmental not-for-profit entities operate in the US today an contribute more than 900 billion annually to the US economy
* successful not-for-profits apply business principles to operate more effectively
* director of not-for-profits spend a great deal of time seeking major donations and memberships to cover costs.

### Factors of Production: The Building Blocks of Business

* factors of production are the inputs in the form of resources required from organizations 
* four traditional factors of production are common to all productive activity
    * natural resources i.e. land, minerals, oil, water
    * labor (human resources) i.e. minds and muscles
    * capital i.e. tools, machinery, equipment, buildings
    * entrepreneurship i.e. people who combine all to produce goods or services with the intention of maiking a profit or accomplishing a not-for-profit goal
* many experts now include knowledge as a fifth factor acknowledging is key role in success
* using factors of productions efficiently, can produce more goods and services with the same resources

## 1.2 Understanding the Business Environment

* Businesses operate in a dynamic environment that directly impacts their operations and success.
* External Environment
    * Economic
    * Political/Legal
    * Demographic
    * Social
    * Competitive
    * Global
    * Technological

### Economic Influences

* this category is one of the most important external influences on business
* i.e. when economy is growing unemployment rates are low and income levels rise
* inflation and interest rates change according to economic activity
* gov tries to stimulate or curtail the level of economic activity through policies it sets like taxes and interest levels

### Political and Legal Influences

* politial climent of a country is another critical factor for managers to consider in daily operations.
* three components of political climate to consider:
    * amount of government activity
    * the types of laws passed
    * the general political stability of a government
* states and local governments also exert control over business — imposing taxes, issuing corporate charters and business licenses

### Demographic Factors

* Demography is the study of people's vital statistics, like age, gender, race, etc....
* i.e. different generations spend their money differently, also impacts workforce

### Social Factors

* attitudes, values, ethics, and lifestyles—influence what, how, where and when poeple purchase products or services.
* difficult to predict, define, and measure because they can be very subjective
* also change as people movbe through different life stages
* i.e. poverty of time
* i.e. women into workforce causing: increasing family incomes, heightening demand for time-saving goods and services, changing family shopping patterns

### Technology

* Technology is the application of science and engineering skills and knowledge to solve production and organizational problems.
* Productivity is the amount of goods and services one worker can produce.
* ability as a nation to maintain and build weath depends in large on the speed and effectiveness

## 1.3 How Business and Economics Work

* A nation's economic system is the combination of policies, laws, and choices made by its government to establish the systems that determine what goods and services are produced and how they are allocated
* Economics is the study of how a society uses scarce resources to produce and distribute goods and services.
* Resources of a person, a firm, or a nation are limited, so economics is the study of choices.

### Global Economic Systems

* today the world's major economic systems fall into two broad categories: free market, or capitalism; and planned economies, inlcuding communism and socialism.
* reality is that many countries use a mixed market system that incorporates elements from more than one economic system.

#### Capitalism

* capitalism also known as the private enterprise system
* based on competition in the marketplace and private ownership of the factors of production(resources).
* large number of people and business buy and sell products freely in the marketplace
* in pure capitalism, all factors of production are privately owned and the gov deson't try to set prices or coordinate economic activity
* capitalist system guarantees certain economic rights
    * right to own property
    * right to make profit
    * right to make free choices
    * the right to compete
* main incentive is profit; encouraging entrepreneurship
* profit is necessary for production
* freedom to choose to be an entrepreneur or work for someone else
* competition is good for business and consumers as it leads to more diverse products, stable prices, increases efficiency of produces


#### Communism

* complete opposite of capitalism
* gov owns all resources and controls all markets
* economic decision-making is centralized
* gov rather than competitive forces in marketplace, decides what will be produced, where, how much, where raw material and supplies will come from, who will benefit, price
* this form of centralized economic system offers little it any choice to a country's citizens
* such tight control of people's lives led to lower productivity
* no reason to work harder or produce quality goods; no rewards

#### Socialism

* economic system in which the basic industries are owned by the government or by the private sector under strong gov control.
* Large-scale industries such as transportation, communications, and utilities are controlled by a socialist state
* smaller business and those considered less critical, like retail may be privately owned 

#### Mixed Economic Systems

* pure capitalism and communism are extremes; real-world economies fall somewhere between the two.
* using more than one economic system

### Macroeconomics and Microeconomics

* Economics has two main subareas.
* Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole; looking at aggregate data for large groups of people, companies, or products considered as a whole.
* Microeconomics focuses on individual parts of the economy, like households or firms.
* macroeconomic factors
    * the national level of personal income
    * the unemployment rate
    * interest rates
    * fuel costs
    * the national level of sales of new vehicles
* microeconomic factors
    * consumer demand for new vehicles versus the existing supply
    * competing models
    * labor
    * material costs and availability
    * current prices and sales incentives

### Economics as a Circular Flow

* the sectors of the economy interact as a circular flow of inputs and outputs amoung households, business, and governments.

## 1.4 Macroeconomics: The Big Picture

### Striving for Economic Growth

* most important way to judge a nation's economic health is to look at its production of goods and services
* the more the nation produces, the higher its standard of living
* economic growth is an increase in a nation's output of goods and services
* gross domestic product (GDP) is the most basic measure of economic growth
* GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a nantion's borders each year
* business cycles are upward and downward changes in the level of economic activity
* recession is a decline in GDP that lasts for two consecutive quarters( 3 month period)
* when economy is growing companies often have a difficult time hiring good employees and finding scarese supplies and raw materials
* when recession hits, may firms find they have more capacity than the demand for their goods and services requires
* last recession, many businesses operated at substantially lower than capacity

### Keeping People on the Job

* another macro economic goal is full employment
* full employment is having jobs for all who want to and can work

#### Measuring Unemployment

* the unemployment rate is used by the govenment to measure how close we are to full employment
* excludes "discouraged workers"

#### Types of Unemployment

* four types frictional, structural, cyclical, and seasonal

##### Frictional unemployment

* Short-term unemployment not related to the business cycle.
* Unemployed while waiting to start a better job
* those reentering the job market
* those entering for the first time, i.e. new college grads
* always present
* little impact on economy

##### Structural unemployment

* also unrelated to business cycle but involuntary
* caused by mismatch between available jobs and the skills of available workers in an industry or region
* i.e. birthrate declines, then fewer teacher are neeed or available workers in area lack skills empoyers need.

##### Cyclical unemployment

* occurs when a downturn in the business cycle reduces the demand for labor throughout the economy
* in long resessions, cyclical unemployment is widespread and even skilled laborers cannot find jobs
* gov van partly conteract with programs that boost the economy

##### Seasonal unemployment

* occurs during specific times of the year in certain industries.

### Keeping Prices Steady

* third macroeconomic goal is to keep prices for goods and services overally fairly steady.
* inflation is when the average of all prices of goods and services rises
* higher prices of inflation reduce purchasing power
* purchasing power is the value of what money can buy
* purchasing power is a function of 2 things in inflation and income
* if prices go up but income doesn't rise or rises at a slower rate, a given amount of income buys less, and purchasing power falls.

#### Types of Inflation

* 2 types of inflation.
* Demand-pull inflation happens when demand for goods and services is grater than the supply.
    * i.e. Would-be buyers have more money to spend thand the amount needed to buy abailable goods and services.
    * Their demand, which exceeds the supply, tends to pull prices up.
    * sometimes described as 'too much money chasing too few good'
* cost-push inflation is triggered by increases in production costs, such as expenses for materials and wages.
    * these increases push up the prices of final goods and services.
    * wage increases are a major cause of cost-push inflation, creating a "wage-price spiral".
        * i.e. a* recession is a decline in United Auto Workers union negotiates a three-year labor agreement that raises wages 3 percent per year and increases overtimepay. Carmakers will then raise car prices to cover their higher labor costs. Also, the higher wages will give autoworkers more money to buy goods and services, and this increased demand may pull up other prices. Workers in other industries will demand higher wages to keep up with the increased prices, and the cycle will push prices even higher.

### How Inflation is Measured

* CIP or Consumer price index is an index of the prices of a "market basket" of goods and services purchased by typical urban consumers. The rate of inflation is most commonly measured by looking at its changes.
* The CIP is published monthly by the Deparment of Labor.
* Major components, which are weighted by importance, are
    * food and beverages
    * clothing
    * transportation
    * housing
    * medical care
    * recreation
    * education
* there are special indexes for food and energy
* department of labor collects about 80k retail price quotes and about 5k housing rent fugures to calculate the CPI
* CIP sets prices in a base period at 100
* base period now is 1982–1984, is chosen for its price stability
* current prices are then expressed as a percentage of prices in the base period
* rise in CPI means prices are increasing
* i.e. CIP was 244.5 in April 2017, meaning prices more than doubled since the base period
* PPI or Producer price index measure the price paid by producers and wholesalers for various commodities, such as raw materials, partially finished goods, and finished prducts.
* PPI uses 1982 as its base year
* PPI family of indexes for many different product categories, including crude goods (raw materials), intermediat goods (which become part of finished goods), and finished goods)
* other PPI indexes, for example, include processed foods, lumber, containers, fuels and lubricants, metals, and construction.
* because PPI measures prices paid by producers for raw materials, energy, and other commodities, it may foreshadow subsequent price changes for businesses & consumers

### Impact of Inflation

* several negative effects on people and businesses
* penalizes people who live on fixed incomes
* hurts savers; as prices rise, the purchasing power, or "real value", of nest egg or savings deteriorates.
