## Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning

AI is discipline. AI is a branch of computer science that deals with the creation of intelligent agents, and are systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously. 

AI has to do with the theory and methods to build machines that think and act like humans.

Machine learning is a subfield of AI. A program or system that trains a model from input data. The trained model can make useful predictions from new (never-before-seen) data drawn from the same one used to train the model.

## Unsupervised and Supervised ML models

2 most common classes of machine learning models are unsupervised and supervised ML models.
Key difference is that Supervised ML models have 'labeled' data that comes with a tag, like a name, a type, or a number.

Unlabeled data is data that comes with no tag.

### What can you do with supervised & unsupervised ML models?

Supervised learning implies the data is already labeled. In supervised learning we are learning from past examples to predict future values.
The model learns from past examples to predict future values.

Unsupervised learning implies the data is not labeled. Unsupervised problems are all about looking at the raw data, and seeing if it naturally falls into groups.

## Where does Deep Learning fit as a subset of ML methods?

Deep learning uses Artificial Neural Networks - allowing them to process more complex patterns than traditional machine learning.

Artificial neural networks are inspired by the human brain.
Like a brain they're made up of many interconnected nodes, or neurons, that can learn to perform tasks by processing data and making predictions

Deep learning models typically have many layers of neurons, which allows them to learn more complex patterns than traditional machine learning models.

Neural networks can use both labeled and unlabeled data. Called Semi-supervised learning.

In semi-supervised learning, a neural network is trained on a small amount of labeled data and large amount of unlabeled data.

The labeled data helps the neural network to learn the basic concepts of the task, while the unlabeled data helps the neural network to generalize to new examples.

## Generative AI

Generative AI is a subset of deep learning, which means it uses Artificial Neural Networks, can process both labeled and unlabeled data, using supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised methods.

LLMs are also a subset of Deep Learning.

## Generative vs Discriminative ML Models
Deep learning models (or machine learning models in general) can be divided into two types - generative and discriminative.

A discriminative model is a type of model that is used to classify or predict labels for data points. Discriminative models are typically trained on a data set of labeled data points, and they learn the relationship between the features of the data points and the labels. Once a discriminative model is trained, it can be used to predict the label for new data points.

A generative model generates new data instances based on a learning probability distribution of existing data. Generative models generate new content.

To summarize: Generative models can generate new data instances and Discriminative models discriminate between different kinds of data instances.

The traditional ML Supervised Learning process takes training code and labeled data to build a model. Depending on the use case or problem, the model can give you a prediction, classify something, or cluster something.

The Generative AI process can take training code, labeled data, and unlabeled data of all data types and build a "foundation model". The foundation model can then generate new content. It can create text, code, images, audio, video, and more.

## What is Generative AI?
-  GenAI is a type of Artificial Intelligence that create new content based on what it has learned from existing content.
- The process of learning from existing content is called training and results in the creation of a statistical model.
- When given a prompt, GenAI uses this statistical model to predict what an expected response might be-and this generates new content.
