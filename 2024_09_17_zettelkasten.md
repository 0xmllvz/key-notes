# ZettelKasten Note-Taking

### Start of my Zettelkasten Journey

[Zettelkasten Note-Taking Method: Simply Explained by Shu Omi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOSZOCoqOo8)

* one of the most effective knowledge management methods
* word zettelkasten means box of cards in German
* developed by Niklas Luhmann; a German sociologist
* Luhmann's Zettelkansten Method helps:
    * build a web of knowledge
    * find connections among topics
    * retrieve the right memory
    * find connections among topics
    * develop ideas and arguments
* all thats needed is small boxes, index cards, and a pen
* 2 boxes
    * 1 reference box with brief notes about the content of the literature
    * the main box where he created new ideas, theories, arguments, discussions, insights

### Zettelkasten Method Steps

1. Take Literature Notes
    * when reading something have an index card and pen
    * write information down you don't want to forget or think you'll use later IN YOUR OWN WRITING OR THINKING
    * keep it short. Be extremely selective. <3 sentences.
    * write in your own words. NO COPY & paste!!!
1. Take Reference Notes 
    * take bibliographical notes when finished reading
    * write this reference information on one side of the index card
    * write a brief note about content on the other side 
    * store the reference notes with the literature notes together in the reference box
1. Make Permanent Notes
    * most important step
    * go through each note you made in the previous step while thinking how they relate to what you're learning, your interests, or research
    * goal is not to collect many notes, rather add value to your existing ideas, arguments, and discussions
    * what's important is finding meaningful connections between how you just learned and what you already know
    1. The more information means more hooks we can use to connect the new information to
    1. The more connected information = more cues we can use to trigger the right memory

### Finding meaningful connections when createing your permanent notes

1. How does this idea fit into what I already know?
1. Can this be explained by something else?
1. What does X mean for Y?
1. How can I use this idea to explain Z?

### Finding Keywords

* important to find keywords in your notes to find connections among notes
* finding keyword is not about where to store the note, but how to retrieve it.
    * DON'T ASK
        * Which keyword is most fitting?
        * What category does this fall into?
    * ASK
        * In which cercumstancesdo I want to stumble upon this note?
        * When and how will I use this idea?
    * keywords should always be assingned with an eye towards the topics you're working on or interested in, never by looking at the notes in isolation

### Adding your permanent notes to box by

1. Filing each one behind relavent notes
1. Adding links to relavant notes
1. Index to make easier to discover later (e.g 23, 24...)

### Extra step: Take Fleeting Notes

* temporary holders of your ideas and thoughts that pop into your mind.
* keep something close so you can write down you ideas
* review fleeting notes within few days and develop them into permanent notes
