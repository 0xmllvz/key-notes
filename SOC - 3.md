# Module 1A & 1B
## 1.1 Sociological Perspective and Sociological Imagination

### The Problem of the Color Line
W.E.B DuBois, a civil rights activist & first African American to earn a PhD in Sociology from Harvard, in "The Souls of Black Folk in 1903" writes. about the socioeconomic and sociopolitical circumstances of African Americans following the Civil Ware and post-Reconstruction, amidst Jim Crow America.

Talks about a double-consciousness, as a "sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity... — this longing to attain self-conscious manhood, to merge his double selves to be lost. He does not. wish to Africanize America, for America has too much to teach the world and Africa; he does not wish to bleach his Negro blood in a flood of white Americanism, for he believes —foolishly, perhaps, but fervently—that Negro bolood has yet a message for the world. He simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an American without being cursed and spit upon by his fellows, without losing. the opportunity of self-development."

"Kimberle Crenshaw explains, our frames should include an analysis of **both gender and race** to better understand the complexity of the human condition"

### What is Sociology?
"Sociology is the systematic study of society and social interaction."
"...sociologists identify cultural patterns and social forces and determine how they affect individuals and groups."

focus on the importance of the social forces affecting our behaviour, attitudes & life changes, achieves a more complete understanding of social reality.

even though we enjoy a great amount of freedom, we have less freedom than. we think, since many of our choices are affected by our society, culture ad social institutions, which may not even realize.

"the social structure plays integral role in the **social location** (i.e., place or position) people occupy in society."

Relying on subjective. viewpoints. and perspectives leads to diffusionn of. misinformation and fake news that can be detrimental to our physical and socio-cultural environment and new

According to C.Wright Mills (1959), the sociological imagination requires individuals to 'think themselves away' from examining personal and and social influences. on people's life choices and outcomes.

## 1.2 Defining Race

### Race as a Social Construct
"...race is more of a social category than a biological one." or , "race is a **`social` construction**, a concept that has no objective reality but rather is what people decide it is"

## Module 1 Dialogs Part 2 Questions
1. **defining race, ethnicity, multiraciality**
	1. "Race refers to a category of people who share certain inherited physical. characteristics, such as skin color, facial features, and stature."
	2. 
2. **intersectionality, resistance, social change** 
3. **deconstructing race and ethnicity**
	1. Race
		1. "Race has been used as a classification system to categorize humans...", "...many biologists question the value of these [racial] categories and thus the value of the biological concept of race", "...we often see more physical difference within a race than between races.", "If clear racial differences ever existed hundreds or thousands of years ago (and many scientists doubt such differences ever existed), in today's world these difference have become increasingly blurred.", "Another reason to question the biological concept of race individual or a group of individuals is often "assigned to a race based on arbitrary or even illogical grounds." like Irish, Italians, and Eastern European Jews who left their homelands for a better life in the US were not regarded as white when in US but rather inferior race. "Today... we call people from all three backgrounds white or European."
		2. What race is a person who has a white parent and black parent? American society usually calls this person black or African American. Under what logic? Even if 75% white and 25% black, the person is likely to be considered Black in US. "...reflects the traditional '**one-drop rule**' in US that defines someone as Black if the person has at least one drop of "Black blood," in Brazil, Black is reserved for someone with no European ancestry at all.
		3. "A third reason to question he biological concept of race comes from ...biology itself," less than 0.1% of all the DNA in our bodies accounts for the physical differences among people that we associate with racial differences, people from difference races are more than 99.9% the same in their DNA. Bamshad and Olson, two geneticists working on mapping the human genome, concluded that "race" does not exist genetically. 
		4. "According to Charles Wagley and Marvin Harris (1958), a people of color is distinguished by 5 characteristics:
			1. Unequal treatment and less power over their lives
			2. Distinguishing physical or cultural traits like skin color or languate
			3. involuntary membership in the group
			4. awareness of subordination
			5. high rate of in-group marriage
		5. I addition to communities of color, additional examples of people of colors might include the LBGTQ+ group, religious practitioners whose faith is not widely practiced where they live, and people with disabilities 
	2. ethnicity
		1. "In the face of the increasing rejection of race as a valid classification scheme, many social scientists have replaced the word race with the word “**ethnicity**” to refer to self-identifying groups based on shared religion, nationality, or culture."
4. **colorism**

# Module 2A Historicizing Racialization
## Ch 2: Sociological Theories and Patterns of Intergroup Relations
### 2.1 What is a Theory?

## Activity: Deconstructing Race & Ethnicity

1. Share your reaction to one or more of the following lessons from Race: The Power of an Illusion and supporting sources:
	1. that the concept of race and racial difference has no basis in science and is what sociologists refer to as "socially constructed"
	2. was used to justify chattel slavery against African people and genocide against Indigenous people at the founding of Colonial 'America'
		1. In the video "Race - The Power of an Illusion Episode 2: The Story We Tell (PBS)," we learn that Thomas Jefferson, a founding member of the United States, declared in the Declaration of Independence that "all men are created equal," despite being a slave owner and expressing views such as, "I advanced it, therefore, as a suspicion only, that the blacks, whether originally a distinct race, or made distinct by time or circumstances, are inferior to the whites in the endowments of both body and mind." The video explains how this perception of Black people as sub-human helped to justify the contradiction that equality and slavery could coexist. Due to the intense demand for labor in the American Colonies, Jefferson's racist ideology flourished. With fewer Europeans willing to make the journey to America, farmers turned to the transatlantic slave trade to gradually replace indentured servants with African slaves. Additionally, the video states that "ordinary white people are not going to be complicit in the [racist] system unless they get something out of it," such as increased status or "ego enhancement." Even descendants of poor white Europeans began identifying solely as white. All these factors contributed to an emerging racial divide that came to be seen as having a natural quality. This is why and how prejudice, as explained in our reading, 4.2: Stereotypes & Prejudice, developed by defining one category—in this case, white—as superior, resulting in prejudice and discrimination. As for Indians, the video "Race - The Power of an Illusion Episode 2: The Story We Tell (PBS)" explains that Jefferson regarded Indians as brave warriors defending their lands, suspecting that they were not much different from Europeans. Jefferson, along with the public consensus at that time, felt that Indians, even though brown, were good "human material" and were influenced by European Enlightenment thinkers who believed that education and environment could improve people. Although this was Jefferson's view, many of the westward-moving white settlers did not share this enlightened perspective of Indians. Instead, they viewed them as "...savages who were trying to destroy peaceful settlers attempting to come in, and thought they should be driven out or exterminated." Within ten years of the founding of the United States, there were already wars with Indian tribes. The United States decided that the cheapest, easiest way to avoid a war with Indians and to gain land was to "civilize" them by assimilating them via Christian religion, English education, and commercial agriculture, converting them from hunters and gatherers to farmers. Also, by confining Indians to a certain acreage, there would be a surplus of land for white settlers. The government aimed to appeal to the interests of the less well-off white American man, who sought to obtain more land to improve their circumstances. From the Indian point of view, this was the empowerment of a population that would take the land that Indians possessed. The federal government promised to remove all Indians from the state, but 25 years after the promise, the Cherokees appeared more integrated than before. Georgia's legislature took action and conducted a lottery auctioning off native land, forcing them out of their homes. Around 1828, Andrew Jackson was elected president on the platform of assisting the "common man" by removing all Indians east of the Mississippi. Nationalism began to equate more to race, as people started believing that nations should be composed of people with similar qualities, features, language, and philosophy, contradicting the enlightened notion of a united humanity.

# Module 2B: Historicizing Racialization (Semester Week 4)
## Ch. 2: Identities (from New Directions in Chicanx and Latinx Studies)
### 2.1: Defining Latinx Demographics
I have been using Obsidian to write organized notes using Markdown. I start reading and writing notes on Monday after 11:59 or Tuesday morning. By beginning my reading/viewing and compiling my ideas early, I feel more at ease; being able to be less hurried thus increasing my quality of work. I tend to do my work incrementally throughout the week, adding to a compiled list of ideas. I aim to finish my response by Friday, that way I have the weekend just in case something comes up. I also ensure to set aside time every week for my wife and our relationship, and for dad duties throughout each and every day. I do wish that our assignments were released on Monday morning, that way we had more context of what it is we're looking for. I believe that would help me get more out of the readings. Also, the last three weeks have been a little more hectic than usual because our driveway is getting paved, and we're staying at my in-laws'. Since there are many of us in the apartment, three families, finding a study spot is sometimes a bit chaotic, but I've found that scheduling and communicating with my wife and cohabitants is key.

I chose to write about the racist systematic dispossession of inhabitants of what would become Mexico, then the American Southwest since I, myself, am Mexican American. I was born in Santa Cruz, but my parents and my relatives were born and raised in Mexico. One racist system, mentioned in our reading, 2.3 A Brief History of Latinx Racial Formation (González), was the creation of social hierarchies and racial classification that was imposed by the Spanish colonizers and even persisted after Mexico gained independence in 1812. There was a caste system created by the Spanish, classifying people based on their race, birthplace, religion, and occupation. Additionally, the institutional inequality that was created during the Spanish colonial period was carried on by the subsequent colonizers. For example, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican-American War in 1848 and the United States incorporated Mexican territories into the US. Another example is how Mexicans' skin color influenced if they were treated as white or non-white; only white Mexicans being granted full citizenship. Even after the Spanish colonial period was over, patterns of racial discrimination and hierarchy were continued by the new Westbound American settlers; defining themselves as superior with their whiteness and Protestantism, continuing the marginalization and oppression of Mexican and Indigenous people.

In 4.2 Indigenous Histories, Wars, Imperialism, and Migration (Espinoza-Kulick & Moreno), we also learn of White settlers expanding Westward and systematically replacing Indigenous peoples with new settlers. Impacts of the displacement of Indigenous communities can be seen still today. Forced migration because of land displacement, war, and colonization has separated families and disrupted Indigenous lives as an effect. De-Indianization, where Indigenous peoples were denied the opportunity to practice their traditions and languages, is still present.
