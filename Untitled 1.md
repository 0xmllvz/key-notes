1.  Describe some of the events and scientific discoveries that shook the late nineteenth century’s confidence in the idea of progress. What effect did these events have on music, literature, and the arts?

In the late nineteenth century, some events and scientific findings changed people's perspectives in progress. For example, Darwin's theory of evolution, made people question long-held religious beliefs and people also started to question about humanity's role in the universe. Overcrowded city areas and exploited workers was a result of industrialization, which highlighted the downside of technological progress. Also, Freud's ideas began uncovering that people have hidden desires and motives. Also, art was greatly affected by these changes. In music, composers like Wagner would select themes of deep worry and inner struggles, which came through in unusual sounds and structure. Literature also got into ideas like feeling disconnected and disappointed, with writers like Dostoevsky exploring human thoughts deeply. Artists like Van Gogh showed the sadness of the time in their emotional, unusual paintings. All of these events left art feeling unsure and broken, mirroring the unsettled times of the late nineteenth century.

2.  Was early twentieth-century music responsive to public opinion?  Was emotional expression to an audience important to early twentieth-century composers?  Explain.

In the early 20th century, music was going through big changes. Composers were rewriting rules trying new things. Some composers cared about what people thought, while others didn't. Some composers were tuned into what the public liked and wanted their music to be popular and appreciated. So, they were more likely to write tunes that were catchy or easy to listen to. But then there were other composers who weren't as concerned about pleasing the crowd. They were more focused on expressing their own feelings and ideas. For them, music was a way to share their emotions, even if it wasn't always easy for everyone to understand or enjoy. They pushed boundaries and experimented with new sounds, sometimes even shocking audiences. So, overall, early 20th-century music was a mix of some composers who cared a lot about public opinion, while others were more focused on expressing themselves.

3.  List and briefly describe the various ways composers embraced or reacted against modernism in the early twentieth century.

Some composers embraced the avant-garde movements of the time, like Impressionism and Expressionism. They also experimented with unconventional harmonies, new forms, and abstract concepts to push boundaries of tradition. Some composers like Stravinsky and Hindemith, in response to the excesses of modernism, looked to the past for inspiration. They revived classical forms and structures, learning more towards clarity, balance, and order in their compositions. Other composers turned to their culture. Nationalistic themes emerged, in which composers would incorporate folk melodies, rhythms, and themes into their music to connect with their heritage. Also, some composers reacted against the standardizing effects of modernism by displaying their individuality in their music. They pursued unique styles and voices, rejecting the idea of adhering to any particular sound. Many composers, rather than rejecting or embracing something completely, they sought a middle ground. They combined elements of traditional tonality and form with modernist techniques, creating a hybrid style tying the old and new.

4.  Discuss the influence of Romantic-era music on film music.

During the Romantic era, composers like Beethoven, Wagner, and Tchaikovsky created music that was full of emotion. They were all about big emotions and telling epic stories through their music. Filmmakers in the present day use some of those same sentiments to make their movies more intense and emotional. Such as epic orchestral scores heard in movies like Star Wars or Harry Potter. Romantic symphonies seem like they would use these type of grandiose scores that modern-day movies use. They make the emotions on screen feel even bigger and more powerful. There are also there could be certain musical themes that surface when a character appears on screen, this seems like Wagner did, helps connect us to the characters and adds layers to the story. So Romantic era music laid the groundwork for how we use music in movies today. Highlighting emotions and making the storytelling even more grand.

5.  Briefly analyze the oppression that modernist composers suffered in totalitarian regimes during the first half of the twentieth century. List three composers who were affected.

In the early twentieth century, modernist composers were very oppressed by totalitarian governments. These regimes were authoritarian, censoring anything that didn't fit their narrative, especially in the arts. Composers faced having their innovative work shut down because it didn't match the government's position. Composers with radical ideas about music in a place where the government decides what's "acceptable.", faced oppression and even extermination. And it wasn't just  the music; these composers often found themselves in serious trouble for their beliefs or associations. Some were also thrown in jail or forced to leave their homes  because they didn't fall in line with the political environment. For example, Dmitri Shostakovich in Russia, was always under the surveillance of Stalin's regime. Or Arnold Schoenberg in Nazi Germany, and Béla Bartók in Hungary, eventually forced to leave because of the fascist regime. These composers' positions during these regimes show us how much power governments had over creative expression and the heavy toll it took on these artists, both personally and artistically.

6.  Briefly describe the musical philosophy of **John Cage**.  Name two non-musical influences on this philosophy.

John Cage believed that music could be shaped by chance randomness rather than rigid rules. Cage's innovative music changed conventional ideas about how music should be made and heard. He believed that life is unpredictable and full of surprises so composers should let chance play a role in their creations. Two influences on Cage's philosophy were Eastern philosophies, especially Zen Buddhism, and the avant-garde dance scene. Cage drew inspiration from Buddhism principles, accepting things as they are. He explored silence and everyday sounds in his music. He also was influenced by avant-garde artists like Merce Cunningham, who was an avant-garde dancer. Cage took these ideas and experimented with new ways of making music, like using random processes and preparing pianos with objects to create unexpected sounds.

7.  Discuss briefly the state of current compositional practice, including three contributing tendencies.

In the current state of contemporary compositional practice, there is eclecticism, which mixes different styles and gestures, pulling from various influences rather than sticking to one style, creating a sort of musical melting pot. Next, there is a "self-conscious" reference to compositions of the past, drawing from and revisiting previous musical styles and traditions. Lastly, there seems to be a tendency towards stronger, more straightforward expression. Instead of intricate music that might have been more nuanced and intimidating, perhaps hard to grasp, composers want their music to speak directly to the audience, making it easier to understand.
