# 2.1 Defining latinx Demographics
To determine the racial and ethnic composition of the nation in 2020, the census incuded two separate question—one for Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin and one for race. According to the USCB, Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin is defined as a persion of Cuban, mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. So, USCB does not consider Hispanic or Latino to be a race, asserting that the categories "generally reflected social definitions in the U.S. and were not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically.

Hispanics were more likely to say the question described them "not too well" or "not well at all," suggesting they found the categories as not providing relevant options. in 2015 the Pew Research Center survey found "...for tow-thirds of Hispanics, their background is a part of their ration backgrounds—not something separate. This suggests that Hispanics have a unique view of race that doesn't necessarily fit within the official U.S. definitions.

- When it comes to describing their identity, most Hispanics perfer their family's county of origin over pan-ethnic terms
- Most Hispanics do not perceive a shared common culture among U.S. Hispanics
- "Hispanic" or "Latino"? Most don't care—but among those who do, "Hispanic" is preferred.
- Most Afro-Latinos identify as"Hispanic" or "Latino," but not all do
- The racial groups Afro-Latinos Identify with can be varied and diverse.
- Most Hispanics use Spanish, but the use of English rises though generations.
- Hispanics also want future U.S. Hispanic generations to speak Spanish

Census is significant because it shapes national, group, and individual identity through it's official classification system. 

There are major limitations with a government entity attempting to categorize a diverse group of people and impose meanings "from above".
