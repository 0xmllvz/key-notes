Music is the art of sound in time. Its temporal aspect is the most basic place to start understanding music, and this aspect is summed up by the term **rhythm**.

## 1 Rhythm
the way music unfolds in time.
taken for granted in our culture and others
driving force in classical and popular music everywhere
"a rhythm" refers to the actual arrangement of durations—long and short notes—in a melody or other musical passage.
handled with precision above other contexts.

**Beats** give the basic unit of measurement for time in music.
if clock time is measured in seconds, musical time is measured in beats.

impossible for people to beat time without making some beats more empathic than others, called giving certain beats and **accent**.

## 2 Meter

any recurring pattern of strong and weak beats, such as the ONE *two* and ONE *two* *three* is called a *mter*. Meter is a strong/weak pattern repeated again and again.
Each occurrence of this repeated pattern, consisting of a principal strong beat and one or more weaker beats, is called a **measure** or **bar**.  In Western music there are only two basic kinds of meter: **duple meter** and **triple meter**.

In *duple meter* the beats are grouped in twos (ONE *two* | | ONE *two*) or in fours (ONE *two* THREE *four* | ONE *two* THREE *four*).

In *triple meter* the beats are grouped in threes (ONE *two three* | ONE *two tree*)

Often the main beats of duple and triple meter are subdivided into quicker pulses. This usually happens by dividing the main beat into either twos or threes. When the main beats in 

Meter is background; rhythm is foreground.
