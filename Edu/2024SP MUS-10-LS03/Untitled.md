Hey Payton,
Your breakdown of late nineteenth-century events and their impact on the arts is great. Darwin's theory and industrialization did shift perspectives, and led to movements like realism and impressionism that delved into human experiences.

You've nailed the essence of early twentieth-century music, highlighting composers' quest to reflect the complexities of modern life. Emotional expression, as seen in Schoenberg and Stravinsky's works, mirrored the era's uncertainties.

Your insights into composers' reactions to modernism are insightful. Schoenberg's atonality and Stravinsky's neoclassicism showcased diverse responses to tradition.

I also appreciate your exploration of Romantic-era music's influence on film scores and the challenges faced by modernist composers in totalitarian regimes. Lastly, your explanation of John Cage's philosophy and the current state of compositional practice is thorough. Great job!
