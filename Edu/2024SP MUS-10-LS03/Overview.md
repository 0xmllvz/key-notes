**Fundamentals**

**Unit 1**, the introductory unit in this class, covers the fundamentals of music and their standard terminology. We start right away with a piece of music, the _**Prelude to The Valkyrie**_ by the nineteenth-century composer Richard Wagner.

**Chapter 1** presents the most basic aspect of music, its organization in time or _**rhythm**_, and introduces important features of this organization: meter and tempo.

**Chapter 2** takes up other basic features of musical sound — pitch, dynamics, and tone color — and also the instruments of the modern orchestra.

Then **Chapters 3 and 4** delve into some additional complexities of **_pitch_** — scales, melody, harmony, and more — and explore how musicians use these to organize pieces of music.

**Chapter 5** carries the discussion one stage further, to include _**musical form**_ and **_style_**.
