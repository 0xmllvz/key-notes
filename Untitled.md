## Introduction

Sociology helps us understand that ours is a stratified society, where access to resources and opportunities is greatly affected by one's social location within institutionalized systems of inequality. Factors such as class, race, ethnicity, gender, nationality, religion, and sexual orientation significantly influence the outcomes for different social groups, creating a pattern of disparity that persists across various institutions. The importance of examining these systemic dynamics at a macro level cannot be overstated. It not only enables a comprehensive understanding of their functioning but also aids in formulating informed strategies to eradicate racism.

The words of Malcolm X resonate deeply with the current societal issues, "If you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches, there's no progress. If you pull it all the way out that's not progress. Progress is healing the wound that the blow made. And they haven't even pulled the knife out much less heal the wound." This statement, though made in 1964, is as relevant today as it was then.

## Historical Agents and the Potential for Change

Sociology further underscores the fact that people are historical agents. We continuously help in the reproduction, and potential transformation, of institutions and culture. This inherent capacity to effect change is crucial in our quest for a more just and sustainable world. As Arundhati Roy puts it, “Another world is not only possible, she is on her way. On a quiet day, I can hear her breathing."

## The Avenue of Social Change

There are many routes to facilitating critically informed social change. One prominent avenue is social policy, which has the potential to achieve racial justice by moving human and economic resources towards concrete actions for change. By shifting our policy focus and resources, we can address racial inequities at their roots and foster the growth of healthy communities.

Other strategies for social change include legislation, litigation, research, community organizing, and education on the histories and contemporary realities of racism from a critical race perspective. It is important to note that education, though essential, is not sufficient. Real transformation requires concerted efforts targeting the root causes of institutional biases.

In the words of Angela Y. Davis, “You have to act as if it were possible to radically transform the world. And you have to do it all the time." The Latin root of the word radical is "rad"—for “root.” Therefore, radical change means addressing social problems at their deepest roots.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, to eliminate racism, we need long-term, multigenerational strategies that address racial and other inequities at their roots. With a critical understanding of the issues, we can imagine policies and community efforts that promote healing, justice, and flourishing communities in the long-term.

For this paper, we put aside concerns of what would easily pass through electorates, legislatures, and courts, and instead, we imagine and document what we believe it would take to create an antiracist future.
