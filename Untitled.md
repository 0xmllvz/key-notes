In the current state of contemporary compositional practice, there is eclecticism, which mixes different styles and gestures, pulling from various influences rather than sticking to one style, creating a sort of musical melting pot. Next, there is a "self-conscious" reference to compositions of the past, drawing from and revisiting previous musical styles and traditions. Lastly, there seems to be a tendency towards stronger, more straightforward expression. Instead of intricate music that might have been more nuanced and intimidating, perhaps hard to grasp, composers want their music to speak directly to the audience, making it easier to understand.
