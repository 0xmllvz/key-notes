music generally does not use the total continuous range of musical sounds. Instead, it draws on only a limited number of fixed pitches. These pitches be assembled in a collection called a **scale**. In effect, a scale is the pool of pitches available for making music.
## 1. Scales
There are many scales used in the musical cultures of the world.  

### The Octave
2 pitches will have a certain distance, or difference in highness and lowness, between them. Musicians call this distance an **interval**. one interval is called the **octave** and seems in some sense to "duplicate" earlier pitch, but at a higher level.

A vibrating string that is exactly half as long as another will *reinforce* the longer string's strongest overtone. This reinforcement causes the duplication effect of octaves.

### The Diatonic Scale
originally used in Western music the scale is a set of 7 pitches within the octave called the **diatonic scale**
